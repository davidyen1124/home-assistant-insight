  ${JSON.stringify(filteredData)}

  <weather_data>

  2. Analyze the data to identify patterns, inefficiencies, or opportunities for energy savings, taking into account the current weather conditions.

  3. Generate 3 to 5 summaries based on your analysis. Each summary should:
    - Begin with an appropriate emoji
    - Be under 100 words
    - Provide an actionable insight to reduce HVAC usage

  4. Consider the following aspects when creating your summaries:
    - Temperature settings and their timing
    - Duration of HVAC events
    - Frequency of temperature changes
    - Potential impact on energy consumption

  5. Ensure your actionable items are specific, practical, and likely to result in energy savings. Examples of good actionable items include:
    - Adjusting temperature settings for specific times of day
    - Recommending programming changes to the thermostat
    - Suggesting complementary actions to reduce HVAC load (e.g., using curtains or fans)

  6. Present your summaries in the following format:
  [Emoji] [Your summary here, under 100 words]
  [Emoji] [Your summary here, under 100 words]
  [Emoji] [Your summary here, under 100 words]
